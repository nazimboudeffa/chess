# My Chess Studies

To use this repo, go to Lichess.org, click on tools>import a game, then, copy past the according PGN

You can ping me or one of my alts on [Discord](https://discord.gg/EpZTKMb) and send me the corresponding game link, I'll play with you if am available (which is probable) and I will also probably only play the PGN available on this repo otherwise, please DO NOT ping me

You can also ping me on [my actual username on chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/hulkdu96delyon) for a blitz, am not really green and I use a fake account so, you can understand, and also am not available like on that Discord server

I am bad at chess, really bad ! Don't waste your time playing with me, because I try to learn and am not as fast as you can expect
